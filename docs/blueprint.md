## Core Features:

- Agent Management System: Enable a comprehensive Agent Management interface supporting creation, editing, and deletion of agents, along with persistent storage and retrieval of configurations via localStorage.
- Interactive Agent Chat: Allow users to engage in direct conversations with selected agents through a chat interface, which supports message sending, file attachments (images), and the display of agent responses, incorporating Markdown formatting and syntax highlighting for code snippets. This must include local storage for persistence.
- Automated Agent Dialogue: Allow the running of automated conversations between two distinct agents, showcasing the dialogue in a clear, bubble-style chat interface that emphasizes the distinct roles of each agent.
- Comparative Response Analysis: Enable a comparison of responses from multiple agents given the same input message, displaying results side-by-side to facilitate easy evaluation of agent performance and variances.
- Agent Pipeline Orchestration: Allow creation, configuration, and execution of agent pipelines, enabling users to define a sequence of agents to process an initial message and display both intermediate and final outputs. Persist the created configurations using localStorage.
